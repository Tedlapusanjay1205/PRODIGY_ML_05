## 📊 Workflow

1. **Dataset Preparation:**  
   - Download the FOOD-101 dataset [here](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/).  
   - Organize data into training and testing sets as per the dataset structure.  

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Resize images to a uniform size (e.g., 224x224).  
   - Normalize pixel values to improve training stability.  
   - Apply data augmentation (e.g., rotation, cropping, flipping).  

3. **Model Development:**  
   - Build and train a custom CNN or use transfer learning (e.g., ResNet50, EfficientNet).  
   - Optimize the model using techniques like learning rate scheduling and early stopping.  

4. **Model Training:**  
   - Train the model on the training dataset and validate it on a separate validation set.  
   - Monitor metrics such as training/validation loss and accuracy.  

5. **Evaluation:**  
   - Evaluate the model on the test dataset.  
   - Generate a classification report and confusion matrix for detailed analysis.  

6. **Deployment (Optional):**  
   - Develop a web application for users to upload images and get food category predictions.

## 📚 Insights

- **Class Imbalance:** Some food classes may be harder to classify due to similar visual features (e.g., pasta vs. noodles).  
- **Data Augmentation:** Improved generalization by adding variations to the training data.  
- **Model Performance:** Transfer learning models (e.g., EfficientNet) significantly outperformed custom CNNs on this complex dataset.
